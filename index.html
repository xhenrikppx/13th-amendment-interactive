      <h2>LINCOLN, Abraham <br/>(1809-1865)</h2>
      <p><img src="img/faces/Abraham_Lincoln_November_1863.jpg" alt="Abraham Lincoln" width="200" />Born in Hardin County, Kentucky (now Larue County), Abraham Lincoln moved to Spencer County, Indiana with his family in 1816 – the same year Indiana came into the Union as the 19th state. The Lincolns moved to Macon County, Illinois in 1830 and eventually settled in New Salem, Illinois. In early adulthood, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois militia, as New Salem's postmaster and later as Sangamon County surveyor, before being admitted to the Illinois bar in 1836. In addition to many petty cases, Lincoln numbered several railroads among his legal clients. As a resident of Springfield, Illinois, Abraham Lincoln was elected to four terms in the state’s House of Representatives (1834-1842) and served in the U.S. House of Representatives as a congressman from Illinois’ 7th district (1847-1849), in all instances as a Whig. After helping to found the Republican Party, in 1858, Lincoln was defeated in his bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate by Stephen Douglas. Two years later Lincoln defeated Douglas to become the 16th President of the United States, winning re-election in 1864.</p>
